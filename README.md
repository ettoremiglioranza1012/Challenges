Challenges - My personal solutions to some programming problems mainly retrieved from 'Sciprog DS Lab' , material kindly granted by Professor Davide Leoni.
I met the professor during the 'summer school for datascience' course. After the school was over, I wrote to the professor, who kindly provided me with material (including the following challenges to solve sa yourself) to delve into programming concepts on python on my own.
